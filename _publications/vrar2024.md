Despite leaving the Gartner Hype Cycle for emerging technologies in 2019, indicating the technology’s maturity, Augmented Reality (AR) still finds relatively few applications in modern industry. To investigate the value of AR-based 3D representation for ab- stract data visualization, we developed and evaluated two distinct visualization methods for presenting informational diagrams. One method involves a conventional 2D representation on the screen of a mobile device, while the other integrates AR by placing an image plane in a 3D immersive scene. Subsequently, we conducted a user study, in which we assessed the feasibility and usability of both approaches, showing that both methods offer distinct advantages. The AR-based visualization provides great overall orientation and navigation, while the 2D visualization offers more precise manipu- lation and spatial flexibility. As users of mobile devices encounter AR more frequently and at increasingly younger ages, this topic remains intriguing and warrants further investigation. Our work investigates whether an AR visualization of complex diagrams is advantageous over display-based representations due to the poster- like spatial anchoring.
