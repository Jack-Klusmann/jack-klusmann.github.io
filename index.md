Hi, my name is Jack Klusmann. I’m a robotics researcher and engineer passionate about leveraging machine learning to create meaningful human–robot interaction. My goal is to help bring robots into everyday life as both assistive partners and intuitive companions.

My recent research has focused on soft robots, built from flexible and compliant materials. I believe these systems hold great promise for human-centered robotics, combining adaptable object grasping with inherent safety around humans. At the same time, their flexibility makes their behavior much harder to model than that of rigid robots. For this reason, I've been developing an end-to-end control framework for a variable-curvature soft continuum robot, with the aim of linking intuitive user commands directly to robot actuation.

I’ve created this site to showcase some of the projects I’ve been working on. I often find it difficult to gauge the real impact of new research just by reading papers or looking at code. My goal here is to give a more application-driven perspective, showing how the methods explored in these projects can open up new possibilities for how humans and robots interact.

Feel free to explore my **[projects](/projects/)**, and reach out if you’d like to connect or learn more!
