Hi, my name is Jack Klusmann. I’m a Master’s student in Robotics, Cognition, and Intelligence at TUM, currently conducting my thesis as a visiting researcher at the Soft Robotics Lab at NUS.

My ambition is to leverage machine learning to create meaningful human–robot interaction and to bring robots into everyday life, both as assistive partners and as intuitive companions.

My current research focuses on soft robotics, robots built from flexible and compliant materials. I believe these systems hold great promise for human-centered robotics, combining adaptable object grasping with inherent safety around humans. At the same time, their flexibility makes their behavior much harder to model than that of rigid robots, pushing us to design entirely new control methods.

For this reason, I am developing an end-to-end control framework for a spiral-shaped soft continuum robot, linking user commands directly to robot actuation. This work spans kinematics, dynamics, sim-to-real transfer, and interactive control.

I’ve created this site to showcase some of the projects I’ve been working on. I often find it difficult to gauge the real impact of new research just by reading papers or looking at code. My goal here is to give a more application-driven perspective, showing how the methods explored in these projects can open up new possibilities for how humans and robots interact.

Feel free to explore my **[projects](/projects/)**, and reach out if you’d like to connect or learn more!
