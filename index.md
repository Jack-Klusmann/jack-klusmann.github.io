Hi, my name is Jack Klusmann. I’m a Master’s student in Robotics, Cognition, and Intelligence at TUM, currently conducting my thesis as a visiting researcher at the Soft Robotics Lab at NUS.

I’m passionate about human-centered robotics, with a particular focus on human–robot interaction and how machine learning can bridge software and hardware to create meaningful interfaces between people and robots. My goal is to leverage machine learning to bring robots into everyday life—not only as assistive partners but also as intuitive companions.

My current research explores soft robotics, a class of robots built from flexible, compliant materials. I believe these systems hold great promise for addressing key challenges in human-centered robotics. Their softness makes them adaptable and capable of handling delicate or irregular objects, qualities that rigid robots struggle with. Most importantly, they are inherently safe, making them well-suited for environments where humans and robots interact closely. However, their flexibility also makes them much harder to control. Unlike rigid robots with predictable joints, soft robots bend and deform continuously, which makes their behavior difficult to model and requires us to design entirely new control methods.

In my current project, I am developing a comprehensive end-to-end control framework for a spiral-shaped soft continuum robot, linking user commands directly to robot actuation. This work spans kinematics, dynamics, sim-to-real transfer, and interactive control.

I’ve created this site to showcase some of the projects I’ve been working on. I often find it difficult to gauge the real impact of new research just by reading papers or looking at code. My goal here is to give a more application-driven perspective, showing how the methods explored in these projects can open up new possibilities for how humans and robots interact.

Feel free to explore the projects section, and if you’d like to learn more or connect, don’t hesitate to reach out!
