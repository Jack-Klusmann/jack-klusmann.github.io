    # 👋 Hi, I'm Jack

    👨‍🎓 I'm a Master's student in Robotics, Cognition, and Intelligence at TUM, currently conducting my thesis as a visiting researcher at the Soft Robotics Lab at NUS.

    🤖 My research focuses on the control and simulation of spiral-shaped soft continuum robots.

    👨‍🔬 Areas I’m digging into:

    - Soft robot kinematics and dynamics (MATLAB, Python)
    - Soft robot simulation, real-to-sim, and sim-to-real transfer (MuJoCo, Python)
    - Integration of rigid and soft manipulators into hybrid robotic systems (Unity, MuJoCo)
    - Human–robot interaction using AR/VR (Unity, MuJoCo)
