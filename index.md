# 👋 Hey, I'm Jack

👨‍🎓 I'm a Master's student in Robotics, Cognition, and Intelligence at TUM, currently conducting my thesis as a visiting researcher at the Soft Robotics Lab at NUS.

🤖 My research focuses on the control and simulation of spiral-shaped soft continuum robots.

👨‍🔬 Areas I’m digging into:

Soft robot kinematics and dynamics (MATLAB, Python)
Soft robot simulation, real-to-sim, and sim-to-real transfer (MuJoCo, Python)
Integration of rigid and soft manipulators into hybrid robotic systems (Unity, MuJoCo)
Human-Robot Interaction using AR/VR (Unity, MuJoCo)
👷‍♂️ Projects in progress below. Always up for feedback, ideas, or collaboration!
